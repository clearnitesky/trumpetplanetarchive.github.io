This website has been created to host posts from the old Trumpet Planet blog, written by Rich Colquhoun since 2014.
As the site is no-longer being updated with regular posts I took it down for a while. However I felt that since it had a lot of traffic and I'd put a lot of time into writing these posts it would be a shme for them to be gone from the internet. In recreating these posts I have made a few edits along the way. A couple have new conclusions or disclaimers at the start. Obviously opinions change over time, so do check back on some of the classics. <br>Thanks for visiting and feel free to get in touch if you wish to discuss any of the content.
<br>My current website can be found at https://neotericbrass.com/ üé∫ü™ê
